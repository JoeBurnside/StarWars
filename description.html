            <h2>Description of the Project</h2>
            <p>I have decided to create my comic strip based on stills from the hugely successful 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Written and Directed by George Lucas it is the first film released in the saga and the fourth chronologically.</p>
            <p>Star Wars is one of the highest grossing film franchises of all time. It is set in a distant galaxy in the distant past and tells the story of the epic battle between the Jedi and the Sith.  It is referenced in many films and television programmes and has spawned many spoof versions such as Spaceballs and Family Guy: Blue Harvest. Lucasfilm also produced its own animated television series and animated feature film as well as a collection of video games. There are also a large amount of books published about the Star Wars universe. There are six films currently in the franchise with a seventh set for production by Disney.</p>
            <p>I have chosen to do my comic on the scene from Episode IV: A New Hope where Darth Vader battles Obi Wan Kenobi and ultimately defeats him. This is an important point in the films plot as Kenobi’s last line to Darth Vader before being reduced to a pile of robes is “If you strike me down then I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.” Luke Skywalker witnesses the death of his mentor only to realise the importance of Obi Wans sacrifice later in the film. </p>
            <p>The comic will be accompanied by a website that describes its creative design and hosts the comic in a complimentary environment.</p>
